1. Open 3 terminals
2. Run the server.py file on terminal 1
3. Run the client.py file on terminal 2 (this is player 1)
4. Run the client.py file on terminal 3 (this is player 2)
5. On terminal 2, type in a message and press enter (this simulates player 1 making a move)
6. On terminal 3, type in a message and press enter (this simulates player 2 making a move)

if player 1 tries to type a message on the terminal while it is not his turn "nothing" will happen (same goes for player 2)
